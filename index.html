    <title>Introduction To Basic commands</title>

    <h1>Basic computer command?</h1>
    <p>
      Lorem ipsum, dolor sit A command, on the other hand, is typically a one-time
      instruction given to a computer or software<b>
        <i
          >A command, on the other hand, is typically a one-time instruction given to a
          computer or software</i
        ></b
      >. Accusantium perferendis, neque, error quos ea vel quas hic maxime consequatur,
      esse incidunt natus excepturi cumque? Placeat recusandae nihil eaque sit? Autem!
    </p>

    <p>
      Yes, you can use commands in virtually any programming language. The syntax and
      structure of the commands may vary depending on the language. For example, in
      Python, you can use commands like print () to display output, or input () to receive
      user input.
    </p>
    <h3>How does a command work on a computer?</h3>
    <p>
      When you issue a command to a computer,<strong>
        it gets interpreted by the shell</strong
      >, which is a user interface for access to an operating system's services. The shell
      translates your command into a language the computer's kernel can understand. The
      kernel then executes the command and returns the result.
    </p>
    <h3>What's the difference between a command and a function?</h3>
    <p>
      A command and a function are similar in that they both instruct a program to perform
      a specific task. However, a function is a named section of a program that performs a
      specific task and can be called multiple times.

    <h1>Could I automate tasks using commands?</h1>
    <p>
      Yes, one of the benefits of using commands is the ability to automate tasks. By
      writing scripts (a series of commands), you can automate repetitive tasks, make them
      quicker and reduce the chance of human error.
    </p>
    <h1>What's an application programming interface (API) command?</h1>
    <p>
      API commands are instructions sent to a software program, allowing interaction with
      it. These commands can be used to retrieve data, update data, or trigger actions
      within the software. APIs are commonly used in web development to interact with
      external services.
